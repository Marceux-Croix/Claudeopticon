# Changelog

## 0.3.4

- The README and the plugin description lead with the ticket system.

## 0.3.3

- A pane opened before 0.3.2 takes the Claudeopticon title after `/reload-plugins`, without a restart.

## 0.3.2

- The pane's title is now Claudeopticon instead of Work.

## 0.3.1

- A background task that a helper agent started now ends when that agent ends. Before, its line could stay on running for good.

## 0.3.0

First public release.

- Work pane: top card, Orchestrator, Background tasks, Agents with a timeline, and the todo.
- Agent cards count tool calls and tokens. A Stop button ends a running agent at once.
- Ticket board (In progress, Open, Done) with group and agent tags.
- Ticket buttons: send to Claude, ask for status, move by hand.
- `move_ticket` tool: Claude asks you before it moves a ticket you moved.
- `report_progress` tool: agents report steps, shown as progress bars.
- Agent to ticket links by `#T` ID, progress claims, a Haiku match, and quoted text.
- Haiku groups, search, and a completed ledger with the archive.
- Todo rules for Claude, with the `rules` option to turn them off.
- Light and dark themes.
