# Changelog

## 0.3.6

- The pane reads the nearest `.claude_todo/`, from the folder the session started in up to the repo root, so a subfolder can keep its own todo.

## 0.3.5

- An agent that finished its work but was never stopped now shows as Idle, with the time it finished. It no longer counts as live, its timeline bar stops at that time, and its last command reads "Last:". The Stop button stays so you can close it.

## 0.3.4

- The README and the plugin description lead with the ticket system.

## 0.3.3

- A pane opened before 0.3.2 takes the Claudeopticon title after `/reload-plugins`, without a restart.

## 0.3.2

- The pane's title is now Claudeopticon instead of Work.

## 0.3.1

- A background task that a helper agent started now ends when that agent ends. Before, its line could stay on running for good.

## 0.3.0

First public release.

- Ticket buttons: send to Claude, ask for status, move by hand.
- `move_ticket` tool: Claude asks you before it moves a ticket you moved.
- `report_progress` tool: agents report steps, shown as progress bars.
- Agent to ticket links by `#T` ID, progress claims, a Haiku match, and quoted text.
- Haiku groups, search, and a completed ledger with the archive.
